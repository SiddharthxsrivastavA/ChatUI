# Project Overview

This project is a responsive web application featuring a dynamic navigation bar and multilingual support, designed to enhance user experience and accessibility. The navigation bar includes a prominent logo with a visually distinct separator, while the language switcher allows users to seamlessly toggle between different languages. The layout ensures all components fit within the viewport, creating a seamless and visually appealing user experience.

## Key Features

1. **Navigation Bar Enhancements:**
   - Introduced a vertical separator between the logo and navigation items using the `Separator` component.
   - Added a language switcher to enable users to change the interface language dynamically.
   - Adjusted the text size of navigation items with `text-sm` for better visual hierarchy.
   - Maintained consistency in the design with a dark background and rounded corners.

2. **Multilingual Support:**
   - Implemented a language toggle feature allowing users to switch between supported languages.
   - Used an internationalization (i18n) library for seamless translation handling.
   - Ensured that all static and dynamic content updates based on the selected language.

3. **Full-Page Layout Optimization:**
   - Adjusted the main container to use `h-screen` for full viewport height.
   - Resolved issues of the footer extending outside the screen by fine-tuning margins and spacing.
   - Enhanced overall consistency with background and design elements.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Managing Language Translations:**
   - Ensuring all UI elements, including navigation items, buttons, and dynamic content, update correctly when switching languages.
   - Handling right-to-left (RTL) support for languages that require it.

2. **Maintaining Design Hierarchy:**
   - Ensuring the logo remains prominent while the language switcher and navigation elements are visually distinct but secondary in focus.

3. **Ensuring a Smooth User Experience:**
   - Providing real-time language switching without requiring a page reload.
   - Optimizing for accessibility to accommodate diverse language needs.

4. **Consistency in Design:**
   - Aligning colors, margins, and rounded corners across components to create a unified look and feel.

Despite these challenges, the project successfully implements a robust and user-friendly interface with a focus on multilingual support, responsiveness, and design consistency.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
